I have 3 of experience in the cybersecurity and DevOps field, working with organizations to implement secure CI/CD pipelines, automate security testing, and build resilient infrastructure.

## Areas of Expertise

I created this blog to share practical knowledge, tips, and insights from my experience in the field. My goal is to help bridge the gap between security and operations, showing how modern DevOps practices can enhance security rather than compromise it.
